## Reasons I like Tolkien

* It can be enjoyed by children and adults alike
* Disney *didn't ruin it*
* It created an entirely new genre of fantasy

1. Sam
2. Aragorn
3. Gandalf
4. Galadriel
5. Legolas
6. Frodo
7. Merry
8. Pippin
9. Bilbo

Here's what `elflang` looks like (the perfect coding language):

```
func main(){
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

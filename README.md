# static-site-generator
Practice project to create static sites from Markdown

The project takes a well formatted markdown document, breaks it into larger html blocks, and then into smaller inline text nodes for each of the larger html blocks. The inline text nodes are converted to HTML and then entire HTML documents are created. Pages are created recursively from a content directory, a static directory, and a template.html file. Markdown to be converted is stored in the content directory, images and css are stored in the static directory.

This is a guided project that I completed with the help of boot.dev. The contents of the static pages that are served is not mine, nor was it created by me.
